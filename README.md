# Dry
**Dry** is a declararive, purely functional, esoteric programming language. Although **Dry** is a general purpose language, it's mostly intended to be used as a tool for learning functional programming.

First-Class Functions
Functions must be first-class citizens in the language, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables.

Anonymous Functions
The language must support anonymous functions (also known as lambda functions or lambda expressions), which are functions defined without being bound to an identifier.

((x, y) => x + y)

lambda(x, y, x + 1)
