# Dry ðŸš±
**Dry** is a declararive, purely functional, esoteric programming language. Although **Dry** is a general purpose language, it's mostly intended to be used as a tool for learning functional programming.

bind -> substitute
Add location in all error messages
Add test for factorial
Allow to overload functions
Accept multiple parameters if, sum, etc
Unused exception
x.value x.toString

## TODO
* Lists and objects
* Higher order functions
    Functions must be first-class citizens in the language, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables.
* Compile to JS
    const add = (a, b) => a + b
* Type inference
* Operators (= + - / * ! & |)
* Imports
* Pattern matching
* Type declaration (maybe, undefined)
* Lambdas
    - ((x, y) => x + y)    
    - lambda(x, y, x + 1)
* Currying
* x:xs
