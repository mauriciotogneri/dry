# Dry
**Dry** is a declararive, purely functional, esoteric programming language. Although **Dry** is a general purpose language, it's mostly intended to be used as a tool for learning functional programming.

## TODO
* Lists and objects
* Higher order functions
    Functions must be first-class citizens in the language, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables.
* Type inference
* Operators (= + - / * ! & |)
* Imports
* Pattern matching
* Type declaration (maybe, undefined)
* Lambdas
    - ((x, y) => x + y)    
    - lambda(x, y, x + 1)
* Currying
* x:xs
